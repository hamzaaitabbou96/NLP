  # Stop-word removal
	 
One of the major forms of pre-processing is to filter out useless data. In natural language processing, useless words (data), are referred to as stop words.
Removing stop words involves filtering out high-frequency words that add little or no semantic value to a sentence, for example, which, to, at, for, is, etc.
